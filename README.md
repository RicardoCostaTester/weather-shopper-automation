# Weather Shopper Automation üå¶Ô∏èü§ñ

This repository contains my practice and learning journey with Selenium WebDriver using Java. 
It is a hands-on implementation of the concepts learned from the LinkedIn Learning course [Test Automation with Selenium WebDriver for Java](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=262850274&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Ftest-automation-with-selenium-webdriver-for-java%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DHb3w%252Fub6QESlQjT2lpDnMg%253D%253D).

## Purpose üéØ
This project aims to:

- Practice and solidify my skills with Selenium WebDriver and Java.
- Explore different testing methods, such as:
  - Functional testing
  - Regression testing
  - Exploratory testing
  - API testing (planned for future iterations).

## Features üöÄ
- Hands-on implementation of Selenium WebDriver basics.
- Gradual enhancement of automation scripts to include more advanced techniques.
- Integration with testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG (to be included as the project progresses).
- Future implementation of API calls to incorporate API testing.

## Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Automation Framework**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Build Tool**: Gradle or Maven (to be finalized)
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit/TestNG (planned for future iterations)
- **Additional Tools**:
  - Postman (for API testing)
  - Aqua (JetBrains) to explore and align with modern market tools

## Project Scope üìã
The initial focus is on practicing:
- Web element interactions
- Locators (XPath, CSS Selectors, etc.)
- Basic and advanced Selenium WebDriver methods

In the future, this project will evolve to:
- Include API testing
- Implement reporting tools
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
